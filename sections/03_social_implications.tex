Allowing false news to proliferate on social media platforms such as Facebook can be seen as enabling misinformation of the public, \cite{tc_facebook_responsibility} and according the PEW Research Center, 44\% of American adults get news from Facebook \cite{pew_social_media_news}  and a furthermore 64\% of Americans believe that false news is causing confusion around current events. \cite{pew_fn_confusion}

Publishers of false news articles do not always have malicious intent; \cite{cbs_fake_news} many are financially motivated. \cite{fb_addressing_hoaxes} Any action affecting the proliferation of false news would affect the economic stability of its creators.
