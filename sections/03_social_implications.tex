\section{Social Implications}


Facebook has become a main source of news for many Americans. 

This has even led to conjecture that the platform's enabling of misinformation may have influenced the results of the presidential election. \cite{bbc_facebook_fake_news_crisis, wp_russian_election_propaganda} 

Facebook's involvement in the election results is heavily overstated and should not be held directly responsible for their sharing. \cite{stanford_fake_news_study}
Censorship
Facebook uses AI instead of human curators to remove bias, denies bias but fired curating team \cite{tc_facebook_ai}


Censorship is not the answer to fake news. \cite{eff_cali_bill_distrastrous}

Many online journals have posted articles on fake news; \cite{tc_what_is_fake_news,telegraph_fake_news,npr_fake_news} even Facebook itself published tips on how to its help center \cite{fb_spot_fake_news} as well as a feature for users to report any article as "fake news". \cite{tc_fb_down_ranks_fake_news}
