\section{Social Implications}

% <= 200 words
% Write a paragraph or two about why your question matters to the greater society. What social values are at stake? (Examples: economy, privacy, security, income distribution, freedom, “democracy,” transparency …) This section is NOT about your question in particular, but why society ought to pay attention to it (in the large). What are the strongest arguments for the importance of potential social consequences here? Who made them? Very briefly give reasoning. Cite all sources
