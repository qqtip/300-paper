The rise of fake news has caused enough of a stir that multiple online journals have written articles on the subject. \cite{tc_what_is_fake_news,telegraph_fake_news,npr_fake_news} Even Facebook itself published tips on how to its help center \cite{fb_spot_fake_news} as well as a feature for users to report any article as "fake news". \cite{tc_fb_down_ranks_fake_news}
