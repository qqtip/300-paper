\subsection{Supportive}


\subsubsection{The goal is not to remove stories}

The goal of the initiative is to focus on removing clearly untrue stories and not opposing opinions --- Facebook will continue to rely on unbiased third parties. \cite{inc_fb_transparency}

\subsubsection{The strategy does not involve direct censorship}

The strategy is centered around flagging untrustworthy content, not removing content. While accounts are being removed, these accounts are ones believed to be constructed with the sole purpose of spreading false news. \cite{inc_fb_transparency}

% ARGUMENTS AGAINST %
%-------------------%
\subsection{Opposing}


\subsubsection{Banning fake news is a curb on free speech}

Using the law to ban fake news is censorship and a violation of free speech. Furthermore, banning fake news will cause political chaos as politicians turn to name-calling and accusations. \cite{eff_cali_bill_distrastrous}

\subsubsection{Removing fake news is a curb on free speech}

Compelling social media outlets to remove fake news is tantamount to censorship. Though it is censorship by a corporation and not the government, it is still a result of government action. \cite{wp_germany_fake_news_law}


\subsubsection{Fact-checking cannot be inherently neutral}

People have very different opinions about what constitutes ``fake news'', and ``fact-checking'' is not inherently neutral. Introducing a human element cannot be achieved without also introducing bias. \cite{vox_sentences_fn} \cite{inc_fb_transparency}

\subsubsection{The selected fact-checkers are uncredible}

``When the media outlets performing the work of fact-checking do not themselves have credibility, no one is going to accept their conclusions. And that ship has already sailed.'' \cite{vox_sentences_fn}
%Critics want more transparency \cite{inc_fb_transparency}}
