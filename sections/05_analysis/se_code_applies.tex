% HOW THE SE CODE APPLIES %
%=========================%
\subsection{How the SE Code Applies}

\par In its preamble, the Software Engineering Code of Ethics defines \emph{software engineers} as ``those who contribute by direct participation... to the maintenance... of software systems.''\cite{se_code} 

\subsubsection{Facebook's News Feed is a Software System}
\label{se_system}

\par ``Facebook's News Feed [is] a popular screen in the Facebook for Android app.'' \cite{fb_nf_android} The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines an ``app'' as ``a computer program that performs a special function'' \cite{merriam_webster} and ``software'' as ``specifically: computer programs.'' \cite{merriam_webster} Facebook's VP of Product Management, Adam Mosseri, further calls News Feed a user-centric \emph{system}, at a technical level. \cite{fb_nf_works} Therefore, Facebook's News Feed is a software system.

\subsubsection{Facebook Maintains its News Feed}
\label{se_maintenance}

\par According to David L. Parnas, ``[software] [m]aintenance is just redesign and redevelopment.'' \cite{parnas} The Facebook ``engineering team spends a lot of time and effort making News Feed reliable, simple, and fast.'' \cite{fb_nf_faster} Mosseri adds that ``[w]e launch changes to the design of News Feed on a regular basis.'' \cite{fb_nf_works} Facebook contributes directly to the re-design --- the maintenance --- of News Feed.

\subsubsection{Facebook is a Software Engineer}

\par As stated in section \ref{se_system}, the Facebook News Feed is a software system. Because the engineers at Facebook contribute to the maintenance of News Feed, they are then subject to the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and ``shall adhere to the code.'' \cite{se_code}
