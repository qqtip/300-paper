% HOW THE SE CODE APPLIES %
%=========================%
\subsection{How the SE Code Applies}

\par In its preamble, the Software Engineering Code of Ethics defines software engineers as ``those who contribute by direct participation... to the maintenance... of software systems.''\cite{se_code} 

\subsubsection{News Feed is a Software System}
\label{se_system}

\par Facebook states that ``News Feed [is] a popular screen in the Facebook for Android app.'' \cite{fb_nf_android} The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines an \emph{app} as ``a computer program that performs a special function'' \cite{merriam_webster} and \emph{software} as ``specifically: computer programs.'' \cite{merriam_webster} Facebook's Vice President of Product Management, Adam Mosseri, further calls News Feed a user-centric \emph{system}, at a technical level. \cite{fb_nf_works} Therefore, Facebook's News Feed is a \emph{software system}.

\subsubsection{Facebook Maintains its News Feed}
\label{se_maintenance}

\par According to David L. Parnas, software ``[m]aintenance is just redesign and redevelopment.'' \cite{parnas} In other words, revising software that has already been designed and developed. \cite{merriam_webster}

\par Facebook introduced News Feed in September 2006. \cite{fb_newsroom} But Adam Ernst of Facebook states that, even now, the ``engineering team spends a lot of time and effort making News Feed reliable, simple, and fast.'' \cite{fb_nf_faster} Mosseri adds that ``[w]e launch changes to the design of News Feed on a regular basis.'' \cite{fb_nf_works} Facebook, then, regularly contributes to the redesign and redevelopment --- the \emph{maintenance} --- of News Feed.

\subsubsection{Facebook is a Software Engineer}

\par As stated in section \ref{se_system}, Facebook's News Feed is a software system. Because Facebook maintains News Feed, Facebook is contributing by direct participation to the maintenance of software systems. Therefore, according the the Software Engineering Code of Ethics, Facebook is a software engineer and ``shall adhere to the code.'' \cite{se_code}
