\begin{abstract}
The spread of fake news via social media and ad platforms like Facebook and Google has caused a great of controversy for the tech giants. \cite{telegraph_fake_news}

In a further push to combat the spread of fake news, Google and Facebook have partnered with First Draft News to create CrossCheck, \cite{crosscheck_launch} which would identify and expose various news sources.

However, was it ethical for Google and Facebook to attempt to curb fake news stories with a platform of self-selected news curators? As software engineers have a responsibility to the safety and knowledge of the public, it was ethical for Google and Facebook to curate news.
