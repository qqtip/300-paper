\section{How the SE Code Applies}

The preamble of the ACM/IEEE Software Engineering Code of Ethics states that it applies to "practicioners... managers, supervisors, and policymakers" of the Software Engineering profession. \cite{se_code}

Those at Google and Facebook -- whether or not "software engineer" appears on their business cards -- must take responsibility for their profession and the fact that, as two of the largest names in modern software, any policies they espouse will become standards by which all software engineers will be judged.
