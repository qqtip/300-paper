\subsection{The Rise of ``Fake News''}

\par Donald Trump popularized the term ``fake news'' during the 2016 United States presidential election, \cite{telegraph_fake_news} but his usage has obscured the original meaning of ``fake news'': articles that intentionally deceive readers for personal or political gain. \cite{npr_fake_news}

\par To distinguish these meanings, some have turned to using the term ``false news'' to describe these articles. \cite{guardian_fb_tips} We will follow suit.

\par While false news is not a new phenomenon --- we used to call it propaganda --- modern technology has turned false news into a profitable product. \cite{bbc_fn_propaganda}

\subsection{Viral Infection}

\par Online social networks like Facebook and Twitter are standout examples of such technologies. Not only do social networks provide an inexpensive, unregulated platform for distribution, \cite{telegraph_fake_news} the users themselves help circulate articles by ``sharing'' them with connected users. \cite{telegraph_fake_news} 

\par Facebook, with 1.28 billion daily active users\footnote{As of March 2017}, \cite{fb_newsroom} provides a vast network for distribution. Considering 2/3rds of its users get news from its social networking service, \cite{pew_social_media_news} Facebook plays a major role in the spread of false news.

\par The size of Facebook has even sparked debate over whether its enabling of disinformation might have influenced the results of the election. \cite{bbc_facebook_fake_news_crisis, wp_russian_election_propaganda} Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, has even received allegations that Facebook enjoys the increased readership and profitability of false news. \cite{tc_facebook_responsibility}

\subsection{Facebook's Reply}

\par In response to this criticism, Facebook has enacted multiple measures to combat the spread of false news. \cite{fb_newsroom,fb_addressing_hoaxes,guardian_fb_tips,tc_fb_down_ranks_fake_news,tc_facebook_ai,telegraph_fb_delete}

\par Early efforts in 2016 included introducing algorithms to reduce the incidence of clickbait
\footnote{Clickbait here is defined as links with titles that are misleading or withhold information to entice users to ``click'' the link. \cite{fb_addressing_hoaxes}} in users' News Feeds \cite{fb_addressing_hoaxes} and allowing users to flag false news articles\footnote{On April 6, 2017, Facebook further published a set of tips for identifying false news. Hundreds of millions of users in 14 countries received notifications of its existence and were prompted to read them. \cite{guardian_fb_tips}}. \cite{tc_fb_down_ranks_fake_news} 

\par In early 2017, Facebook expanded its efforts by working alongside various news agencies and fact-checking organizations internationally to flag false news stories. \cite{guardian_steps} As of May 2017, Facebook is reported to have deleted tens of thousands of accounts that spread false news. \cite{telegraph_fb_delete}
