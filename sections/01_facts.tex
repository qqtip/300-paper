Though Donald Trump popularized the term "false news" during the 2016 American presidential election, \cite{tc_what_is_fake_news} his usage has only served to obscure the original meaning of false news: news that intentionally deceives readers for personal or political gain. \cite{tc_what_is_fake_news, npr_fake_news}

While this is not a new phenomenon --- disinformation has been historically used for propaganda \cite{bbc_fn_propaganda} --- modern technology has pushed false news to new levels of efficacy and profitability by removing regulations and easing distribution. \cite{telegraph_fake_news}. Tech giants Facebook and Google play a major part in the spread of false news due to their sharing functionality and ad space, which aide the propagation of false news stories. \cite{cbs_fake_news, tc_google_took_down_ads}

The size of Facebook has even sparked debate over whether its enabling of misinformation might have influenced the results of the presidential election \cite{bbc_facebook_fake_news_crisis, wp_russian_election_propaganda} and even allegations that Facebook enjoys the increased readership and profitability of false news. \cite{tc_facebook_responsibility}

In response, Google has taken down billions of ads from its network \cite{tc_google_took_down_ads} and Facebook has added support for flagging false news as well as publishing various guides to users regarding hoaxes and clickbait. \cite{tc_fb_down_ranks_fake_news,fb_reduce_clickbait,fb_addressing_hoaxes,fb_spot_fake_news} However, these efforts have encountered criticism from
