# Facebook's Fake News Feed
---------------------------
The spread of false news on Facebook has been a source of international controversy since the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. In response to allegations that it may have influenced the election’s outcome, Facebook has enacted various measures to suppress false news on its News Feed. But is it ethical for Facebook to curate the news? Some journalists commend Facebook for taking ownership of its role in shaping current events. Others denounce their efforts, citing bias and calling it censorship. By identifying the danger of disinformation, Facebook is accepting responsibility for the safety and knowledge of its users. Therefore, Facebook’s actions are in their users’ best interests and are consistent with Principle 2 of the Software Engineering Code of Ethics.
